Reflections and Comments

How did this go, overall? Terrible, with a great outcome. I ran into 1 problem each lab that ran off days of time when each of the fix were cause of redering order count and syntax errors. AND MAKING SURE IDS MATCH IN HTMLS.

What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far? CHECK PUNCTUATIONS ROUTINELY.

How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
